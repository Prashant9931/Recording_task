This is a conversion b/w client and emp.The clint wnats to a generic function that interats to db and extract info .clint something talks about Formatting  in python.
cli also talks about something side project,campaion summary and db design .
Clint also wants unit testing it may be pia-test.
----something normal talks
It talks about some methods.
Inside a current process a  data transfer process and geresizes process and a fom fod .
It a utility, process and a generic process ,unit process. Emp also add a delete method and a primary id thats follow refrencial intigrity .
Client more focus on data intigrity part 
------Working of function
->The function takes data and trasform into pandas datafrme(may be loading data fast). 
->A keys class contacts settings campaion ca one to one realtionship.
->flow of project like
key class
         contacts setting


-Client donot  want to change output but he wants to code to be more generic, optimal,uniform and more reusability.
->new db name : NewPalmTest

->Same syntax can only change syntax that required to extract data.

->method where user give campaign id and get info about campaign if no event create one.
->Unit test need to be done automatically
->client giving all code for changing and will give back to him for review after change by employee 
->employee getting error in query he was running on client db, its an error in variable parameters

->client  wants coming to meet monday if there is no snowfall.-employee asked about timing to client and he told to report to Miss Brandy and Miss Kelly
->After that they discuss about some issues in the office then they told whom and why employee need to report to that day
->It talks somethig about war room 

It something taks about----
dummy structure 
then code on project

some  points about project:
--------------------------------------
generalizing code
maintain referential integrity
Making it more optimize
Increase reusability
Additional features
---------------------------
combined excel with formatting using python script
data transformation using any python tool
unit test(pia test)
